RUNNING INSTRUCTION
To run the Data Analysis Process. Open Data Analysis-notebook.ipynb and run all cells. 
To run SVM Machine Learning Method. Open SVM_2.ipynb and run all cells.
To run MLP Machine Learning Methos. Open MLP_2.ipynb and run all cells.
The best training model for both SVM and MLP are saved as SVM-Model and MLP-model.
To run the saved model for each method, open SVM_2.ipynb, MLP_2.ipynb run the load model cells.
